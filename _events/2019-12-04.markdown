title:  "Is the Trinity Incoherent?"
description: >
  Christians believe in the Trinity. This doctrine have confused both Christians and non-Christians. Skeptics have also pointed to the Trinity to show that Christianity is logically incoherent and is a blind leap of faith. In this session, we will explore this doctrine and see how to make sense of it.
