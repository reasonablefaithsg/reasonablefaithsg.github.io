title:  "Evolution: Friends with Atheism?"
description: >
  Richard Dawkins said "the evidence of evolution reveals a world without design." It is a common idea that the theory of evolution contradicts Christianity and supports atheism. In this session, we will take a look at Alvin Plantingaâ€™s Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism (EAAN). Plantinga offers a philosophical argument that it is irrational to believe both atheism and evolution at the same time. If he is right, then there is deep conflict between evolution and atheism. I will then briefly discuss whether there is deep conflict between evolution and Christianity.
